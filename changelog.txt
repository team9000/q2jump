fixed a few issues relating to a blank id being assigned (mapsleft for example when no identity loaded)
removed ALL goodmap code. addedtimemap replaces addedtimegood/bad/neutral
gset voteseed added, default 20. if you are using the new maplist format (and have maps played figures in html stats) this option makes sure 1 map
  from the 20 least played maps is shown 0,1,2 or 3 of the voting positions (chosen at random). set to 0 to disable

  models must be placed in players/ghost directory, with names such as homer.md2 and homer.pcx. the homer.md2 MUST be
  edited so that it has a default skin pointing to homer.pcx. I have compiled 100 models in this way so you dont need to

Antiglue penalty has been added. gset antiglue_penalty <value>. 1 = 0.1 second penalty per jump made with antiglue on
  this only applies when mset/gset antiglue is 2
  when antiglue is 2 and a user turns on antiglue, they will be prevented from setting a 1st place time
  antiglue_allow1st defaults to 0. If 1st place is 10seconds and user sets a time of 8seconds, their time will be increased to 8+(10-8)*2=12 seconds

with interpolation using the value of gset completion_seed
Added 'updatescores' command and ADMIN_UPDATESCORES_LEVEL (to be used after changing completion_seed)

Added Hannibal's code for:
Disabled 'nomapvotetime' when there's less then 3 people on the server
Fixed bug where gibs meeting a trigger_hurt would crash the server (the big one?)

0.83wp
